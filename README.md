## PhenoTrack3D: an automatic high-throughput phenotyping pipeline to track maize organs over time

This work is based on our biorxiv report (TODO), by Benoit Daviet, Romain Fernandez, Llorenc Cabrera-Bosquet, Christophe Pradal and Christian Fournier.
PhenoTrack3D can be used to track leaf organs over time, in a time-series of 3D maize plant reconstructions. 
Such 3D reconstructions can be obtained from sets of RGB images with the Phenomenal pipeline (https://github.com/openalea/phenomenal)
